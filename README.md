# BalanceList25

This console application uses `curses` along with `npyscreen` for interactive dialogs.

## Setup
Install requirements manually using the commands listed in `redistro.txt`:

```bash
pip install pyodbc
pip install openpyxl
pip install pywin32
pip install windows-curses
pip install npyscreen
```

## Usage
Run `python main.py` from a terminal. Dialogs for confirmations are now presented
via pop-up boxes instead of keyboard prompts.
